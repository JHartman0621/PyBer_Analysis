                                                          Analyzing rider data using Matplotlib and Pandas
                                                          
Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze data from riders as well as drivers so as to determine metrics such as average fare by city type. The analysis examined differences in fares depending on whether the rider is in an urban, suburban or rural city type. We  examined how the city type impacts the average fare per driver and the average fare riders pay.
